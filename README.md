	This program implements a small mathematical library that approximates the functions arcsin, arccos, arctan, and ln. The program is built using mathlib.c and mathlib-test.c, both of the object files for these 2 files are linked and compiled to create an executable version of the program that will run and output whichever functions you specify in the command line along with the corresponding library function and the difference between the 2. The -a flag will print all the functions, -s for arcsin, -c for arccos, -t for arctan, and -l for log. To run the file type"make" or "$make all" into the command line and the object files should be created and linked to create the executable file you can then run. Use make clean to delete all files created when compiling.
